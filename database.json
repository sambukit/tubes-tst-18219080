{"forum": [{"forumID": 1001, "userID": 1, "title": "I\u2019m a teacher, and I can\u2019t live like this.", "discussion": "In the United States, we have mandated that our children are physically present at school for a massive chunk of the time they spend awake. Children spend almost as many hours at school as they do at home. For the first two years of this pandemic, opinion columnists warned that we better get our children back into the school buildings for the sake of their mental health. The problem is teachers are not mental health professionals, and schools can\u2019t or won\u2019t budget for kids\u2019 mental health needs. Nonetheless, children won\u2019t thrive academically until their physiological and safety needs are met (e.g. food, housing, safety from bullying and other violence, etc.). We let shameful numbers of our children rot away in school all day, while horrified but largely helpless adults attempt to offer them something helpful. It\u2019s maddening shit, soul-crushing shit. It\u2019s low graduation rates, high teacher turn-over, increasingly dangerous staffing shortages, but somehow more police in the hallways. Children living in communities that\u2019ve historically been targeted by state violence bear the brunt of it. Anyway here we are, three months back in the buildings full-time: School and district administrators are doing a bad job at the work public health administrators do, and teachers are doing a bad job at caring for children\u2019s mental health. Predictably, kids are failing a lot of classes because they can\u2019t figure out why they\u2019re not motivated to do anything at all. Often they\u2019re skipping classes and getting into all kinds of serious trouble. Some folks are calling for admin to hire a private security force to patrol the school\u2026 which is a whole other essay of NO."}], "reply": [{"replyID": 1001, "userID": 2, "message": "This is an interesting take you've got", "forumID": 1001}, {"replyID": 2, "userID": 2, "message": "Keep your spirits up!", "forumID": 1001}, {"replyID": 3, "userID": 1, "message": "Thanks", "forumID": 1001}], "catalog": [{"itemID": 1001, "name": "Casual Tee", "price": 90000, "desc": "Slim-fit t-shirt, comfortable to use for hot seasons, comes with different colors", "images": "https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/id/imagesgoods/442868/item/idgoods_69_442868.jpg?width=1600&impolicy=quality_75", "size": "S,M,L", "redirectLink": "https://www.uniqlo.com/id/id/products/E442868-000?colorCode=COL69"}, {"itemID": 1002, "name": "Slip-on Sandal", "price": 25000, "desc": "Your regular sandals, simple yet stylish", "images": "https://dynamic.zacdn.com/K41wvLelb26jOfO4VSXSlnEjlPE=/fit-in/472x690/filters:quality(90):fill(ffffff)/https://static-id.zacdn.com/p/puma-6596-1092992-2.jpg", "size": "34,35,36", "redirectLink": "https://www.zalora.co.id/puma-fluff-remix-women-s-sandals-black-2992901.html"}]}
